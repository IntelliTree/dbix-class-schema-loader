immediate stuff for 0.04:
--------------------------

avinash240 wants a rescan method to pick up new tables at runtime

-------

support multiple/all schemas, instead of just one

support pk/uk/fk info on views, possibly.  May or may not be a sane thing to try to do.

Fix up ResultSet Manager / Methods / etc stuff.  May require some work in the
main DBIx::Class first.

SQLite needs some heavy refactoring, the subroutines are becoming too complex to understand easily.

Refactor RelBuilder so that it doesn't require a live mostly-built
DBIx::Class::Schema, so that other modules (SQLT) can use it easier.  And then
when/if we get there, break it out as a seperate distribution with a new name.

Relationship stuff:
   If local column is UNIQUE or PK, use has_one() for relation?
   Re-scan relations/tables after initial relation setup to find ->many_to_many() relations to be set up?
   Check NULLability of columns involved in the relationship, which might suggest a more optimal non-default -join-type?
   While scanning for many-to-many, scan for implied rels as well? (if foo->belongs_to('bar') and baz->belongs_to('bar'), does that impliy foo->might_have('baz') and the reverse?)
   ...
