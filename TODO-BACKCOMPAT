SL Backcompat Plan:

* rewrite un-singularized class names (in e.g. custom relationships) in both
  preserved custom content and external content from un-singularized classes

* make use_namespaces the default, and upgrade to it properly

*** Catalyst Helper

* Add 'upgrade=1' option that upgrades from both old S::L and old helper,
  whichever or both.
* Warn when old helper output or 0.04000 S::L output is detected, that refers to
  the upgrade option.

Release dev S::L, announce to catalyst, dbic lists and #catalyst that testing of
backcompat mode is needed, wait 2-3 weeks, then release 0.05000.
